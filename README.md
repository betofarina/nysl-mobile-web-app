User Friendly Mobile Web App design to show game information from the nysl website.

I designed the web application to be simple and straight to the point. The parents would just need to know which team theirs children play for and they will quickly have all the information they need to know about the next matches in a friendly,colorful and simple way. 

The web app is powered by Framework7, JQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, JS, CSS and HTML and hosted by Firebase.

How to use:

Inspect the web so you can display it on any mobile screen.

In the first page you can click on "Sign Up" to go to the second page, then you can click in any team and will show you the upcoming games for that team, then you can select any game and will show you all the game information, also you have a switch in the top right corner if you want the app to display all the upcoming games of the league.
